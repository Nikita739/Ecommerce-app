# Ecommerce-app
This is my first fullstack project. Made with PostgreSQL, express, NodeJS, react, sequelize.
# WARNING
It's not a final build. So it is REALLY big. Client folder won't even open on github
# How to run
To run this app, git clone it into an empty folder, go to server folder and run "npm run dev". Then go to client folder, and run "npm start"
